      The Game Boy is an 8-bit handheld game console developed and manufactured
      by Nintendo. It was first released in Japan on April 21, 1989, in North
      America later the same year, and in Europe in late 1990. It was designed
      by the same team that developed the Game & Watch series of handheld
      electronic games and several Nintendo Entertainment System games: Satoru
      Okada, Gunpei Yokoi, and Nintendo Research & Development. It is Nintendo's
      second handheld game console and combines features from both the Game &
      Watch handheld and NES home system. The console features a dot-matrix
      screen with adjustable contrast dial, five game control buttons (a
      directional pad, two game buttons, and "START" and "SELECT"), a single
      speaker with adjustable volume dial and, like its rivals, uses cartridges
      as physical media for games. The color scheme is made from two tones of
      grey with accents of black, blue, and dark magenta. All the corners of the
      portrait-oriented rectangular unit are softly rounded, except for the
      bottom right, which is curved. At launch, it was sold either as a
      standalone unit, or bundled with one of several games, among them Super
      Mario Land and Tetris. Several accessories were also developed, including
      a carrying pouch, a camera, and a printer.
